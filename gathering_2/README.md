# Prototyping materials and electronics
### Materials: 9v battery, computer, resistors of various resistances, breadboard, multimeter, safety glasses, LEDs, microcontroller (arduino, feather, etc.), USB to micro-USB cable.
#### Objective: Getting familiar with components regularly used in circuits and the testing equipment used to check them.
If you need help with circuit building, choosing resistors, and so forth for this particular project, the link below is very helpful.

LED = Light Emitting Diode  
1. Light up an LED using a 9v battery, wires, a breadboard, and an LED.
   1. Breadboard: A way to prototype circuits without soldering.

   2. Measure the voltage across the LED with a voltmeter throughout the experiment. A voltmeter is used to measure voltage across two points. To use the voltmeter: set the dial to V and touch the positive lead to the positive lead (cathode) of the LED and the negative lead to the negative lead (anode) of the LED.
   3. Connect the LED to the battery while keeping the voltmeter leads connected to the LED (use a buddy or alligator clips).
