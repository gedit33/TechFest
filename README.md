## Building a foundation in electronics and microcontrollers
  Through this collection of guided projects we strive to build a strong component-based foundational knowledge of electronics. With this foundation we hope you will be able to tinker or build as you would with Legos, creating or modifying electronic devices to meet your needs. As scientists meddling with electronics and vice-versa, our focus beyond the foundational knowledge, lies in microcontrollers and sensors. Tools that allow us to measure and ask questions about the world around.
